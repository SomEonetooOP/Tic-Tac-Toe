Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ with a human vs. computer mode. The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move, making the game unbeatable.

 Features
	•	Human vs. Computer gameplay
	•	Computer plays optimally using AI (Minimax Algorithm)
	•	Command-line interface (CLI) with clean board display
	•	Interactive and user-friendly design

Technologies Used
	•	C++ (Core Logic, OOP Concepts)
	•	Recursion & Backtracking (for Minimax)
	•	Game State Evaluation
